               <h4 class="title">Standardization vs. Localization</h4>
               <p>A  couple of weeks ago, while doing some cross-cultural research on   websites, I  stumbled onto several McDonald's’ websites in different   countries. It was  particularly striking that each of the sites was   radically different, not just  in terms of text and translation, but   from the kind of images used, typography  selected, color palettes   designed, layouts chosen, to even the favicons! </p>
               <p>As  I looked at more examples from different countries, it appeared   that the  European websites were more similar visually when compared to   the set of Asian  websites. While I debated whether it was a good design   strategy or stereotyping  of cultures, it was clear that McDonald's   felt it was important.</p>
               <p>On  the one hand, the user interface design process focuses wholly on   the user and  his context — his needs, wants, expectations and   preferences — and on the other hand,  global businesses want to cater to   and engage with consumers across the world  and consider demographic   diversity which, while possible, can get very  complicated. </p>
               <p>Imagine  your favorite e-commerce website being visited by users from   different parts  of the world, assuming that language translation is   successful; are there  elements of it that might make it difficult for   them to navigate through the  site? Are there metaphors that they simply   would not understand? How about  mental models; do users from different   cultures look for different data to make  decisions? There are several   other questions that illustrate the depth of this  problem. But the   bottom line is to help make communication effective between a  global   business and a local user. It simply isn’t enough to use a standardized    website that translates the text and utilizes the same images, layout   and  color of the parent site (Becker and Crespo, 2001). For instance,   consider the  OK gesture; in most English-speaking countries, it is a   sign of everything  working well, but in several European countries the   same gesture means “zero”  or “worthless.” </p>
               <p>The  debate around standardization versus localization in website   design continues  to be a bone of contention. While some argue that due   to the nature of the  internet, cultural distance will minimize and we   will see a homogeneous online  culture. Many other research studies show   that consumers prefer to visit and  interact with sites that are made   specifically for them and which contribute to  online customer trust,   satisfaction and e-loyalty (Cyr, 2004). Even so, the  goal of culturally   sensitive usability is to understand different cultural  perspectives   holistically with the user-centered design approach, and to avoid    stereotyping cultures or making tacit assumptions about politically   correct  design.</p>

               <h4 class="title">Research on cultural differences</h4>
               <p>Much  research around cultural differences has been published. Few    of these works are well known, with particular focus on Fons Trompenaars   and  Geert Hofstede’s work. </p>
               <p>Trompenaars, a prolific Dutch researcher in the field of    cross-cultural communication, with Hampden-Turner, studied how people   from  different cultures solve problems. Hofstede, an influential Dutch   cultural  anthropologist and psychologist, conducted extensive and   exhaustive interviews  with IBM employees in 53 countries in the early   1970s, with over 100,000 data  points. Both Trompenaars and Hofstede   discovered that there were significant  differences among cultures in   different countries. Both went on to define  culture as a set of shared   characteristics such as thoughts, values and  behaviors. Based on their   research, Trompenaars and Hofstede formulated different  theories on   cultural dimensions, which defined sharp lines of distinctions along   which  cultures differ. </p>
               <p>Given  the global platform of the Internet where social experiences   are shared and  communal interaction occurs, it becomes critical for web   and web-based  application design to consider culturally diverse user   groups. While some fundamental  principles of usability, such as   simplicity and consistency, are elemental, in  such situations there are   certain design characteristics that need to be  reflected upon.</p>
               <p>According  to Cyr (2004), there are critical characteristics of design that need attention  in a cultural context: </p>
               <ul class="listItemLarge">
                 <li>Language, which is a distinctive  aspect of   different cultures, which when moved to the online domain presents its    own challenges of quality of translation, representation and stylistic    elements.</li>
                 <li>Layout that serves as a  communication bridge   between the user and the system, it involves placement of  banners, menu   items, orientation, amongst others.</li>
                 <li>Symbols refer to “metaphors”  denoting actions for   the user and vary from culture to culture. They may be  icons used for   currencies, locations, and other navigational elements.</li>
                 <li>Content or structure, referring  information or features that the site offers and its organization. <br>
                   Navigation that is easy to use and  facilitates access to information.</li>
                 <li>Multimedia, including video, animation,  images and sound.</li>
                 <li>Color – where color semiotics  varies across cultures and can impact user expectations. </li>
               </ul>

                 <div class="col_12 pL0">
               <h4 class="title">Hofstede’s Five Dimensions</h4>
               <p>The  concept of culturally sensitive design includes all these   characteristics as  well as the emotions, behaviors and ways of thinking   of the individuals also  considered as users (Eristi, 2009). As  per   Eristi, Hofstede’s cultural dimension theory seems to be effective in   the  culturalization process of appeal in web design. </p>
               <p>According  to Hofstede (1980), world cultures vary across certain consistent and  fundamental values. These 5 dimensions are:</p>
               <ul class="">
                 <li>Power distance</li>
                 <li>Collectivism vs. individualism</li>
                 <li>Femininity vs. masculinity </li>
                 <li>Uncertainty avoidance </li>
                 <li>Long vs. short-term orientation</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Marcus and Gould (2000) make several inferences from Hofstede’s    theory and how it can be adapted to cultural differences. Scientists   have  continued to build upon their work, creating many ‘best’ practices   for cross-cultural  interface design. </p>
               <p>Let’s  take a very brief look at each of Hofstede’s dimensions and   preliminary implications  for user-interface and web design to make   design characteristics culturally relevant: </p>

               <h4 class="title">Power Distance (PD)</h4>
               <p>This is the extent to which less powerful members of  organizations   accept that power is distributed unequally. High power distance    countries are more autocratic; low power distance countries are more   democratic. </p>
               <p>Implications:<br>
                 Marcus  and Gould  mention that high power distance countries have a   stronger  focus on expertise, authority, experts, certifications,   official stamps and  logos, amongst others. Access to information is   restricted and social roles are  used to organize information (managers’   section vs. non-managers’ section). </p>
               <ul class="listItemLarge">
                 <li>Introducing       visuals, expressions, images with authoritative   body language, that are       informative and guiding will work well in   high power distance countries.       Low power distance cultures may   prefer activities of daily life, popular       images, symbols and   colors. </li>
                 <li>Clear indicators       of navigation that present all information at   once are appreciated in high       power distance countries, whereas   less dense and informally organized       structure is preferred in low   power distance countries. </li>
                 <li>High power distance cultures       tend to prefer sites with a   formal layout but with more vivid visuals.       Limited choices and   restricted access to information is favored. Visual       elements that   are resonant with the pulse of the nation are valued. </li>
                 <li>Low power distance countries       prefer informal layouts with   clear access, and multiple choices on use.       Flexible interactions   that guide in case of errors will be valued. Visual       elements that   are more universal are preferred.</li>
                 </ul>
               <p>Kuwait has an index  of 90 on the dimension of power distance,   meaning that it values hierarchy,  top-down direction and centralized   power. The information architecture is very  organized with very little   information for the press or the presence of a media  center. There are   very few choices people can make. It has a formal layout but  can look   “flashy” with the overbearing presence of red. The images used are    powerful and used to guide the user into the site. </p>
               <p>Ireland has a lower power distance index of 28. They value  informal   structures where hierarchies are not maintained very strictly. The    Coca-Cola Ireland  site is very transparent in sharing information. The   information architecture  is shallow and clearly surfaced. Search   functionality is provided for multiple  choices on use and the site   encourages exploration.</p>

               <h4 class="title">Individualism vs. Collectivism (IDV)</h4>
               <p> This refers to the degree to which individuals are integrated  into   groups. Individualistic societies emphasize personal achievements and   individual  rights. Collectivist societies emphasize group affiliations   and loyalty. </p>
               <p>Implications:<br>
                 In  the same paper, Marcus and Gould (2000) believe that motivation is   based on  personal achievement in individualistic cultures, while   collectivist societies  value harmony and consensus to move forward. </p>
               <ul class="listItemLarge">
                 <li>Content based on       materialism and consumerism will work well in   individualistic cultures,       and those that represent community and   harmony will work better in       collectivist societies. </li>
                 <li>Language, sound,       videos and metaphors that emphasize   individual successes will be       preferred in high IDV countries; with   larger successes and goals will       matter more in low in IDV   cultures. </li>
                 <li>Individualistic       countries will value importance given to the   youth, whereas social actors       of experience and wise leaders will   be preferred in collectivist cultures. </li>
                 <li>Sites that offer       extrinsic rewards tend to be valued by cultures that are highly       individualistic.</li>
                 </ul>
               <p>With a score of 76 on  the IDV index, Italy  is a very   individualistic culture. Personal achievement and a sense of self are    important and this is highlighted in the Italian version of Match.com.   Only one  image is used and portrays a young couple emphasizing the   importance of   youth. </p>
               <p>Venezuela has a score of 12, and is among the most collectivist   societies  in the world.  There is a high  preference for belonging to a larger group and people   are expected to be  virtuous and act for the greater good. In the   Venezuelan site for Match.com,  this is reflected clearly with the   number of people both young and middle-aged  shown in the background.   They represent community and harmony which is  important to collectivist   societies. </p>

               <h4 class="title">Femininity vs. Masculinity (MAS)</h4>
               <p>This talks about the distribution of emotional roles between genders.    Masculine cultures are competitive, assertive, materialistic; feminine   cultures  place more value on relationships and quality of life. </p>
               <p>Implications:<br>
                 High  masculinity cultures place importance on traditional gender,   family and age  distinctions, whereas feminine cultures emphasize the   blurring of gender  roles. </p>
               <ul class="listItemLarge">
                 <li>Visuals with a       feminine theme including family will be   preferred in highly feminine       countries, and male dominated   cultures will prefer images related to       competition, meetings,   success, personal gratification, etc. </li>
                 <li>Symbolic       indicators and metaphors of achievement, results, and   objectives will be       preferred in high MAS countries, whereas   social activity and interaction       will be valued in low MAS   cultures. </li>
               </ul>
               <p>With a MAS score of  79, Austria  is a high masculinity culture. The   society is decisive, and values success and  personal gratification.   This is seen in the KFC Austria site, where winners and  dreams are   clearly surfaced on the homepage. </p>
               <p>On the other hand Denmark has a  score of 16 on the scale, making it a   feminine culture. Such societies value  caring for others and quality   of life. The KFC site for Denmark makes  an apparent differentiation   with the softer colors and feminine icons and  metaphors. The homepage   highlights the video where social activity and caring  for society is   prominent. The visuals used also suggest consuming the meal with    friends. </p>

                   <h4 class="title">Uncertainty Avoidance (UA)</h4>
                   <p>This refers to the degree of tolerance for uncertainty and    ambiguity. High uncertainty avoidance cultures are more emotional, and   control  changes with rules, laws and regulations. Low uncertainty   avoidance cultures  are more pragmatic, and have as few rules as   possible.</p>
                   <p>Implications:<br>
                     Cultures  with high uncertainty avoidance would emphasize simplicity,   clear metaphors,  limited choices and restricted amounts of data,   according to Marcus and Gould  (2000). </p>
                   <ul class="listItemLarge">
                     <li>Content and       visuals that are clear and concretely associated   with lives of individuals       will be preferred greatly by high UA   cultures. More general and symbolic       messages with less detail will   be valued by low UA cultures. </li>
                     <li>Redundant cues       in color and typography that increase ambiguity   are shunned by cultures       with a high uncertainty avoidance index.   They prefer very clean and       distinct choices. </li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>With a score of 112, Germany is one  of the countries that fall high   on uncertainty avoidance. According to  Hofstede, given their   philosophical heritage, they have a strong preference for  deductive   rather than inductive reasoning. A systematic overview needs to be    given in order to proceed. The T-Mobile site provides plenty of   information;  visuals clearly indicate the message, and typography and   colors  cues are not redundant and help reduce ambiguity. </p>
                   <p>Singapore has a score  of 8 on the UA index meaning that people   maintain decorum and follow rules but  not because of the need for a   structure but because they fall high on the power  distance index.   Messages on the T-mobile site are very clinical. The information    architecture is very shallow, not dense with detail. Several links are   repeated  many times within the homepage. </p>

               <h4 class="title">Long vs. Short-term Orientation (LTO)</h4>
               <p>This refers to the time horizon of a society. Long-term oriented    societies are oriented to the future, and are pragmatic, rewarding   persistence  and saving. Short-term oriented societies are oriented to   the present and  the past, rewarding reciprocity in social relations and   the fulfilling of  social obligations. </p>
               <p>Implications:<br>
                 High  LTO countries would value relationships as a source of information   and  credibility and content that is focused on practical value,   whereas low LTO  countries would prefer content based on truth, desire   for immediate results and  achievement of goals. </p>
               <ul class="listItemLarge">
                 <li>Content and visual       elements that are focused on rules as a   source of credibility are valued       more in low LTO countries whereas   high LTO cultures are oriented by the       search of virtuous   behavior. </li>
                 <li>Content and navigation       that emphasize long-term development   and goals of the business will be       valued by high LTO cultures.   Providing future plans and guiding the users to       understand their   future relationship with the brand will be greatly       appreciated by   high LTO cultures. Other symbolic indicators that focus on         immediate gratification will be favored by low LTO countries. </li>
                 </ul>
               <p>With a score of 118  on the short-term vs. long-term orientation,   China is one of the most long-term  orientation cultures in the world.   They value virtuous behavior and long term  planning and commitment. For   example, the information architecture of the site  has surfaced their   CSR initiatives on the homepage. The visuals and their slugs  talk about   responsibility, reciprocity and efficiency to create a better world. </p>
               <p>On the other hand,  the United Kingdom  is one of the most short-term   orientation cultures in the world. For example, Wrigley’s  UK  website   clearly focuses on small but immediate gratification with the tagline in    the image. The news aggregator widget mentions everything that’s new   and so do  the other images at the bottom. The layout is very clean and   organizes  information to allow the easiest access to information. </p>

                   <h4 class="title">Conclusions</h4>
                   <div>
                     <p>It  is interesting to note how each of these dimensions can have a   considerable  effect on global web design. From shallow vs. deep   information architectures,  access to information, motivation and trust,   security and personal information,  navigation, simplicity, graphical   elements, to even color, among others. </p>
                     <p>This  becomes especially important in contemporary settings when   e-loyalty is critical  in online transactions, and visual appeal is one   of the ways to increase trust.  Human beings instinctively make snap   judgments about everything they see and  try to rationalize it   afterward, and so it becomes essential to get a positive  first   impression. </p>
                     <p>The  idea of website globalization  has two complementary processes.   As per  Periera and Singh (2005), globalization consists of website    internationalization and website localization that work in tandem. While    internationalization refers to the back-end processes of creating   modular and  accessible global website templates, localization refers to   the front-end  customization where websites are adapted to meet   expectations of a culturally  diverse user group. </p>
                     <p>In the e-commerce environment especially, the market is  truly global   even for a start-up. It is necessary to have a framework that  allows   cross-cultural design and usability as part of the development life    cycle of any website. There will soon be a need for creating tools that   allow  for cultural versioning to suit global businesses and their   agenda to  communicate effectively to the local user. Involving cultural   factors in the  design process increases the aesthetic value,   perceivable quality and  behavioral intention in the users.</p>

               		<p>Nehal gives a fine overview of the issues in software   internationalization and localization. And I know that Apala Lahiri   Chavan and her ICE team are working on cost-effective ways of managing   these challenges. </p>
                    <p>This is critical for companies which serve global markets. I also   think that there is a challenge beyond the classic accommodating of   language, data formats, and even cultural dimensions. I think that   countries have very different ecosystems. Sometime cohorts and   subcultures have very different ecosystems. So, for a really competitive   solution, we need to be designing for the very different ethnographic   context between major target areas. </p>
                    <p>The roles that  people play vary. The artifacts they use vary.   Despite the internet, the globe contains many highly disparate worlds.   When the power goes out in Chicago, people stop everything and often   approach panic. In Bangalore, it does not even cause a pause in the   conversation.</p>

                   <p class="mB0">Amazing article. I love it. It helped me to realise why certain websites   seems so difficult to navigate while others seemed to be just fit for   me. It has opened my eyes and mind on how cultural differences does   indeed shape our web experience and needs. I can finally confidently   say, it is not me that was the problem it is the website. LOL.

				<p class="mB20">HFI may disclose personally identifiable information collected from Users to its parent, subsidiary and other related companies to use the information for the purposes outlined above, as necessary to provide the services offered by HFI and to provide the Website itself, and for the specific purposes for which the information was collected. HFI may disclose personally identifiable information at the request of law enforcement or governmental agencies or in response to subpoenas, court orders or other legal process, to establish, protect or exercise HFI’s legal or other rights or to defend against a legal claim or as otherwise required or allowed by law. HFI may disclose personally identifiable information in order to protect the rights, property or safety of a User or any other person. HFI may disclose personally identifiable information to investigate or prevent a violation by User of any contractual or other relationship with HFI or the perpetration of any illegal or harmful activity. HFI may also disclose aggregate, anonymous data based on information collected from Users to investors and potential partners. Finally, HFI may disclose or transfer personally identifiable information collected from Users in connection with or in contemplation of a sale of its assets or business or a merger, consolidation or other reorganization of its business.</p>
				
				<h4 class="title">Personal Information as Provided by User</h4>
				<p class="mB20">If a User includes such User’s personally identifiable information as part of the User posting to the Website, such information may be made available to any parties using the Website. HFI does not edit or otherwise remove such information from User information before it is posted on the Website. If a User does not wish to have such User’s personally identifiable information made available in this manner, such User must remove any such information before posting. HFI is not liable for any damages caused or incurred due to personally identifiable information made available in the foregoing manners. For example, a User posts on an HFI-administered forum would be considered Personal Information as provided by User and subject to the terms of this section.</p>
				
				<h4 class="title">Security of Information</h4>
				<p class="mB20">Information about Users that is maintained on HFI’s systems or those of its service providers is protected using industry standard security measures. However, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and HFI cannot guarantee that the information submitted to, maintained on or transmitted from its systems will be completely secure. HFI is not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures relating to the Website by any Users or third parties.</p>
				
				<h4 class="title">Correcting, Updating, Accessing or Removing Personal Information</h4>
				<p class="mB20">If a User’s personally identifiable information changes, or if a User no longer desires to receive non-account specific information from HFI, HFI will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update and/or remove that User’s previously-provided personal data. This can be done by emailing a request to HFI at hfi@humanfactors.com. Additionally, you may request access to the personally identifiable information as collected by HFI by sending a request to HFI as set forth above. Please note that in certain circumstances, HFI may not be able to completely remove a User’s information from its systems. For example, HFI may retain a User’s personal information for legitimate business purposes, if it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, for account recovery purposes, if required by law or as retained in HFI’s data backup systems or cached or archived pages. All retained personally identifiable information will continue to be subject to the terms of the Privacy Policy to which the User has previously agreed.</p>
